    "The purpose of this milestone is to start getting acquainted to the network that you will use for this class. In the first part of the milestone you will import your data using [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) and you will create the adjacency matrix using [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org). This part is project specific. In the second part you will have to compute some basic properties of your network. **For the computation of the properties you are only allowed to use the packages that have been imported in the cell below.** You are not allowed to use any graph-specific toolboxes for this milestone (such as networkx and PyGSP). Furthermore, the aim is not to blindly compute the network properties, but to also start to think about what kind of network you will be working with this semester. "

In order to do that you will have to chose a distance that will quantify how similar two nodes are based on the values in their corresponding feature vectors. In the [graph from features]() demo Benjamin showed you how to build feature graphs when using Euclidean distances between feature vectors. Be curious and explore other distances as well! For instance, in the case of high-dimensional feature vectors, you might want to consider using the cosine distance. Once you compute the distances between your nodes you will have a fully connected network. Do not forget to sparsify by keeping the most important edges in your network.\n",
