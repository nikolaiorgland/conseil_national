        "\n",
        "There are several questions in this milestone that ask you to plot a signal on your network.\n",
        "There are several ways from which you could approach it.\n",
        "In all cases, compute the position of the nodes a single time at the beginning, as this is likely to be a costly operation.\n",
        "Using a single layout for all the graph plots will also make it easier to compare the plots.\n",
        "Indeed, the only thing changing between plots is the signal displayed.\n",
        "You can represent the features/labels lying on the graph via node **colors**.\n",
        "To do so, make sure to have a consistent color map throughout and remember to display a colorbar and scale in all plots, so that we can tell what numbers the colors represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "* An option is to use the **Laplacian eigenmaps** that you have seen in the previous milestone to embed your graph on the plane. For example:\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n",
        "  plt.scatter(eigenvectors[:, 1], eigenvectors[:, 2], c=signal, alpha=0.5)\n",
        "  plt.colorbar()\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "* Another option is to use the plotting capabilities of **[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io)**.\n",
        "  See the documentation of its [drawing methods](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html).\n",
        "  For example:\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  import networkx as nx\n",
        "  graph = nx.from_scipy_sparse_matrix(adjacency)\n",
        "  coords = nx.spring_layout(graph)  # Force-directed layout.\n",
        "  coords = eigenvectors[:, 1:3]  # Laplacian eigenmaps.\n",
        "  nx.draw_networkx_nodes(graph, coords, node_size=60, node_color=signal)\n",
        "  nx.draw_networkx_edges(graph, coords, alpha=0.3)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "* Another option is to use the plotting capabilities of the **[PyGSP](https://github.com/epfl-lts2/pygsp)**, a Python package for Graph Signal Processing.\n",
        "  **Note that your are forbidden to use the PyGSP for anything else than plotting.**\n",
        "  See the documentation of its [plotting utilities](https://pygsp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/plotting.html).\n",
        "  For example:\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  import pygsp as pg\n",
        "  graph = pg.graphs.Graph(adjacency)\n",
        "  graph.set_coordinates('spring')  # Force-directed layout.\n",
        "  graph.set_coordinates(eigenvectors[:, 1:3])  # Laplacian eigenmaps.\n",
        "  graph.plot_signal(signal)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "* Yet another option is to save your graph on disk, use **[Gephi](https://gephi.org)** externally, to visualize the graph, save the graph with the Gephi coordinates and finally load the nodes coordinates back into the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "We encourage you to try all the above methods before making your choice. Then be consistent and use only one throughout the milestone.\n",
